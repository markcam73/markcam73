- 👋 Hi, I’m @markcam73
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more. That's it really. It's hard to define what peaks my interest at times.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning automation through the use of Ansible, Bash scripting and a bit of Powershell as well. 
    Looking forward to future projects I have in mind on CICD pipeline automation and improvements. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to CICD and cloud development.
